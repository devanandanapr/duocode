### Project Description
DUOCODE- is a website that gamifies learning programming languages. Whether you are a newbie or a pro , with streaks, quests and levels, this is your one stop shop to attain coding mastery.

### The Problem statement
Coding can be intimidating and boring to many. With complex technicalities, it is every newbie's nightmare.

### The Solution
Duocode addresses the problem by gamifying the learning process and making coding interesting. The users can ask questions and doubts and check if the syntax is correct in the mini compiler.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Languages used:
- JavaScript (for logic and functionality)
HTML (for structuring the UI)
